    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Make the Caesar Dressing</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 0% Greek yogurt, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, grated parmesan cheese, drained capers, anchovy paste, garlic, and fresh squeezed lemon juice in a food processor. Buzz until well combined. Season with salt and cracked black pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
        <li>**Option to add a touch of water if you like a thinner dressing. The thicker the yogurt the more water you will need to thin it out, unless you prefer a thick dressing. *</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Setup the Breading Station</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1. Add cornstarch, kosher salt and cracked black pepper to one plate. Mix well.</li>
        <li>*Step 2. Add one large egg and milk to the second plate. Whisk well.</li>
        <li>Step 3. Add grated parmesan cheese, panko breadcrumbs and Italian breadcrumbs to the third plate. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Next, butterfly two chicken breasts into four thin cutlets. Lightly season the chicken with kosher salt and cracked black pepper. Pound thin if needed.</li>
        <li>Run the cutlets through the breading station. Start with the cornstarch mixture, followed by the egg mixture then finally the breadcrumb mixture, making sure each cutlet is well coated.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Air Fry the Chicken Cutlets</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees. Spray the basket with avocado oil spray. Add the chicken cutlets making sure not to overcrowd the basket. The cutlets should not overlap. Spray the cutlets with avocado oil spray and bake for 8-10 minutes flipping halfway through. Spray the second side with avocado oil spray so they get crispy and golden brown. Work in batches if necessary.</li>
        <li>The internal temperature should reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit to ensure doneness. Cooking time will vary based on the thickness of the chicken.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make the Salad</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash, dry, and chop your romaine lettuce. Add the lettuce to a large mixing bowl. Add as much or as little dressing as you desire. Grate or chop two hard-boiled eggs into the salad and season with a few turns of cracked black pepper. Toss until the lettuce is well coated in the egg and dressing.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assemble the Cutlets</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Once the chicken cutlets are cool to touch, pick one up and add a few scoops of Caesar salad to the chicken cutlet. Add a squeeze of fresh lemon and enjoy!</li>
