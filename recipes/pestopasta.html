    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Once you try this recipe, I can guarantee you’ll fall in love. The tender pasta tastes amazing with the pesto sauce and grated eggs. The egg melt into the sauce and add some extra protein too.</p>
        
    <p>Option to use homemade pesto or store bought is fine too. If you use store bought, I recommend Delallo Foods pesto. It checks all the boxes.</p>
        
    <p>When cooking the pasta, be sure to reserve about a 1/2 cup of pasta water. You might not need all of it, but it’s better to have enough saved. The pasta water helps thin out the pesto when you combine it with the pasta. Plus, the starch and salt in the water add a lot of flavor. It tastes amazing.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta</li>
        <li>Pesto</li>
        <li>Hard Boiled Egg</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Seasonings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil a pot of water and cook 4 ounces of pasta al dente. Reserve about ½ cup of pasta water and drain the pasta in a colander. Set it aside.</li>
        <li>Grab a food processor, and combine basil, garlic, parmesan cheese, extra virgin olive oil, pine nuts, fresh squeezed lemon juice and a pinch of kosher salt. Buzz until well combined.</li>
        <li>In a large sauté pan, over medium heat, add butter. Once the butter is melted, add the cooked pasta, homemade pesto, and a touch of the reserved pasta water. Stir until well combined. Add the pasta to a bowl and grate some parmesan cheese over the top. Finish the dish by grating one hard-boiled egg over the top.</li>
        <li>Taste and season accordingly. Serve hot with a wedge of lemon.</li>
